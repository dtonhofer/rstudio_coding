### The R Inferno

by Patrick Burns, 2011-04-30

> Abstract: If you are using R and you think youâ€™re in hell, this is a map for you. A book about trouble spots,
> oddities, traps, glitches in R.  Many of the same problems are in S+.

### The Foundations of Statistics Reconsidered

by Leonard J. Savage, University of Michigan

Appears in: _Vol.1 of the Proceedings of the Fourth Berkeley Symposium on Mathematics and Probability, Berkeley, University of California Press, 1961._

> Introduction: This is an expository paper on the evolution of opinion about the foundations of statistics.
> It particularly emphasizes the paths that some of us have followed to a position that may be called
> Bayesian or neo-Bayesian.
> The intense modern growth of statistical theory of which this Symposium is a manifestation has been
> strongly oriented by a certain view as to the meaning of probability. I shall try to explain why another
> view seems now to be entering upon the scene almost of its own accord and to suggest what practical 
> implications it brings with it.

### The origins and legacy of Kolmogorov's Grundbegriffe

by Glenn Shafer and Vladimir Vovk

_"A shorter version was published under the title "The sources of Kolmogorov's Grundbegriffe" in
Statistical Science 21, 70 - 98 (2006)"_

> Abstract: April 25, 2003, marked the 100th anniversary of the birth of Andrei Nikolaevich Kolmogorov, the
> twentieth century's foremost contributor to the mathematical and philosophical foundations of probability. The year
> 2003 was also the 70th anniversary of the publication of Kolmogorov's _Grundbegriffe der Wahrscheinlichkeitsrechnung_.
> Kolmogorov's _Grundbegriffe_ put probability's modern mathematical formalism in place. It also provided a philosophy of
> probability - an explanation of how the formalism can be connected to the world of experience. In this article, we
> examine the sources of these two aspects of the _Grundbegriffe_ - the work of the earlier scholars whose ideas
> Kolmogorov synthesized.
